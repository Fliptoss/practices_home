#there are two types of modules : 
'''
1. Build it module : these modules are ready to import and use and ships them with the python interpreter
There is no need to install such modules explicitly.
2. External Module : these modules are imported from third party file or can be intalled using a package manager
like pip or conda. Since the file is written by someone else , we can install different versions of the same
module with time.
